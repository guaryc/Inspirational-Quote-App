This script is for an inspirational quote app, once an end-user enters there name they will receive a random positive message, in today's society we need to be as positive as possible and since we have our mobile devices in our hands seemingly at all times I thought it would be a great idea to create an app that provides a positive message when needed. Looking for "random" Python module to pull different messages once a user enters their name.
